# Turn-Anything-Into-Piano 🎹

Ever wondered what your voice would sound like as a piano? Or how about your cat's meow? This code takes ANY sound and transforms it into piano MIDI music using Fourier Transform ✨

## Inspiration 💡  

This project was inspired by:  
- [Mark Rober's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBEL3YVzMwk)
- [Vinheteiro's Talking Piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6e2c0v4sBM)

## What it does? 🤔

1. Analyzing the frequency components using Fast Fourier Transform
2. Finding the dominant frequencies
3. Mapping those frequencies to corresponding piano keys
4. Generating a MIDI file that you can play with any piano synthesizer
